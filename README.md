# Radical (Headless)

This project is meant to replace [Radical V1](https://github.com/Rust-CMS/radical)

## Project Description

Radical is a headless (with a head that will be disable-able) CMS heavily inspired by [Processwire](https://processwire.com/). This is not a markdown site generator like other CMSs. If you would like something of that nature, see [here](#repositories-like-this).
